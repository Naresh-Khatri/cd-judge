# CD-Judge

CD-Judge is a robust code execution engine developed as an evolution of the Coding Ducks project. It serves as a reliable solution for running and evaluating code submissions in a secure and controlled environment.

## Overview

This project was born from the need for a more robust code execution system to replace the makeshift coderunner in the original Coding Ducks project. CD-Judge provides a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for executing and evaluating code submissions.

## Features

- Secure code execution in isolated environments
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Real-time code evaluation
- Resource usage monitoring and limitations
- Standardized input/output handling
- Test case management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Installation

## Architecture

CD-Judge uses a containerized approach to execute code securely. Each submission runs in its own isolated environment with:

- Resource limitations
- Network restrictions
- Filesystem isolation
- Memory constraints
